# Repository for my implemetation of cyphers
I just want to make some cryptographic algos in my free/procrastinating time. \
Every algo will be implemented in c and will expect input on stdin \
and its first argument will be password \
So if you want to encrypt file you can do it like this
```
./program password < inputfile > outputfile
```
## Already done
* RC4
* A5
* MD5
